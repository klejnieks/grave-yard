# cl.kunder.webview
This cordova plugin enables you to open a second webview in your app.
This webview is totally independent from the main webview, but allows you tu access plugins and other Cordova resources.

It's possible to modify this plugin to allow multiple webviews.

## How to use it

First, add the plugin to your cordova application

    cordova plugin add github.com/arturokunder/cl.kunder.webview.git

To open a new webview, just call in your app's js:

    webview.Show(URL);

Where `URL` is the path to the page to be opened. In Android, the plugin automatically adds the prefix `file:///android_asset/www/`

Then, to close the second webview and return to the main view, call in your second webview (the opened webview, not the main webview):

    webview.Close();

This will close and destroy the second webview.
